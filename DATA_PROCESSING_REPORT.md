## Preprocessing Pipeline Implementation

### Stage 1: Band-pass Filtering (0.5-8 Hz)
- **Purpose**: Isolate heart rate variability frequencies
- **Filter Type**: 4th order Butterworth filter
- **Implementation**: `scipy.signal.filtfilt` (zero-phase)
- **Frequency Range**: 0.5-8.0 Hz
- **Result**: Noise reduction while preserving cardiac signal components

### Stage 2: Downsampling (2175 Hz → 30 Hz)
- **Downsampling Factor**: 72.5x reduction
- **Method**: `scipy.signal.decimate` with anti-aliasing FIR filter
- **Input**: 21,900 samples per signal
- **Output**: ~302 samples per signal
- **Benefit**: 73x memory reduction while preserving essential information

### Stage 3: Data Augmentation
- **Method**: Gaussian noise addition
- **Noise Level**: 5% of signal standard deviation
- **Expansion Factor**: 4x (67 → 268 samples)
- **Implementation**: `np.random.normal(0, σ*0.05, length)`
- **Purpose**: Increase dataset size for robust model training

### Stage 4: Signal Normalization
- **Method**: Z-score standardization (StandardScaler)
- **Result**: Mean=0, Standard Deviation=1
- **Application**: Per-signal normalization
- **Purpose**: Stabilize training dynamics and improve convergence

### Stage 5: Train/Validation/Test Split
- **Strategy**: Subject-level separation (no data leakage)
- **Ratios**: 60% train, 20% validation, 20% test
- **Implementation**: Based on unique subject IDs
- **Benefit**: Ensures model generalizes to new subjects
